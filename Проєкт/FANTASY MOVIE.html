            <p class="FANTASY15">Common Elements of Fantasy Movies:<br>
                ✦ Magical Elements: The presence of magic is a defining characteristic, whether it's wielded by characters, inherent in objects, or a fundamental part of the world itself.<br>
                ✦ Mythical Creatures: Dragons, elves, dwarves, orcs, fairies, and other fantastical beings often play significant roles.<br>
                ✦ Epic Scope: Many fantasy films feature grand narratives, heroic quests, and conflicts between good and evil that determine the fate of entire kingdoms or worlds.<br>
                ✦ Medieval or Ancient Settings: While not always the case, fantasy movies frequently take place in settings reminiscent of historical periods, often with castles, knights, and ancient lore.<br>
                ✦ Clear Moral Dichotomies: Themes of good versus evil are often central, with heroes embarking on journeys to defeat dark forces.<br>
                ✦ Symbolism and Allegory: Fantasy worlds can sometimes serve as metaphors for real-world issues or explore timeless human themes.</p>
