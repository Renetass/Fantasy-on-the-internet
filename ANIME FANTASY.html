            <div class="FANTASY5"><p>Fantasy anime is a broad and captivating genre that encompasses a wide array of imaginative worlds, magical systems, mythical creatures, and epic adventures. Here's a look at the different kinds of fantasy anime, the potential first of its kind, and some interesting facts:   </p>
            <p class="FANTASY6">Kinds of Fantasy Anime:
                The fantasy genre in anime is incredibly diverse, but some common subgenres and themes include:</p>

                <img class="babochka" src="babochka.png">\
                <p class="FANTASY7">✦ High Fantasy: Often set in fully realized, intricate fictional worlds with their own histories, cultures, and rules. Magic systems are usually well-defined and play a significant role. Examples include Record of Lodoss War, Berserk, and The Heroic Legend of Arslan.<br>   
                ✦ Sword and Sorcery: Focuses on warriors, swordsmanship, and often a more raw and dangerous form of magic. Adventures are typically more localized. Claymore and early Slayers series fit this category.<br>
                ✦ Isekai (Otherworld): A hugely popular subgenre where a protagonist from the real world is transported to or reincarnated in a fantasy world. This often involves adapting to new rules and powers. Examples include That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation, and Sword Art Online.<br>   
                ✦ Fairy Tale/Mythological Fantasy: Draws heavily from existing folklore, fairy tales, and mythology from various cultures. Examples include some adaptations of classic tales and anime like Princess Tutu.<br>   
                ✦ Light Fantasy: Tends to be more lighthearted, comedic, and focused on adventure without overly dark or complex themes. Later seasons of Slayers and Konosuba: God's Blessing on This Wonderful World! are good examples.<br>
                ✦ Dark Fantasy: Explores darker themes, often with morally ambiguous characters, grim settings, and violent or disturbing content. Berserk is a prime example.<br>
                ✦ Science Fantasy: Blends elements of science fiction with fantasy, often featuring magical abilities alongside advanced technology. Aura Battler Dunbine is considered an early example of this blend.<br> </p>
