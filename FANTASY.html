            <div class="FANTASY1"><p>Fantasy is a genre of literature, film, and art that involves magical or supernatural elements that do not exist in the real world. It often features imaginary worlds, mythical creatures, and powerful beings like wizards, dragons, elves, and other fantastical entities. Common themes include the battle between good and evil, quests, and heroic journeys.
                In literature, some of the most famous examples of fantasy include J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings, C.S. Lewis’s The Chronicles of Narnia, and more recent works like J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series.</p>

            <p class="FANTASY2">Fantasy allows creators and audiences to explore ideas, emotions, and moral questions in unique settings far removed from everyday reality, encouraging imagination and wonder.</p>

            <p class="FANTASY3">Fantasy is also a genre that includes magical or supernatural elements that do not exist in reality. It often features imaginary worlds, mythical creatures (such as dragons and elves), and powerful beings (such as wizards). Common themes include good versus evil, quests, and heroic journeys. Fantasy allows for the exploration of ideas and emotions in unique settings, fostering imagination and wonder. It is characterized by magic, imaginary worlds, archetypal characters, and often epic scope. Subgenres include high fantasy, urban fantasy, dark fantasy, and more. Its appeal lies in moving the audience and exploring themes through creative storytelling.</p>
            <p class="FANTASY4">The term “fantasy” itself comes from the Greek word “phantasia,” meaning imagination and appearance. It entered the English language in the 14th century, initially referring to illusions. Over time, it evolved to describe the power of the imagination. Although fantastical elements have always been present in myths and folklore, the 19th century saw the emergence of authors who consciously created imaginary worlds, such as George MacDonald and William Morris. The mid-20th century was a turning point, when J. R. R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings cemented “fantasy” as a distinct and popular literary genre. Since then, it has evolved into a diverse category with many subgenres.</p>
